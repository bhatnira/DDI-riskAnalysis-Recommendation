# Human Evaluation of Drug Interaction Explanations

## Instructions

You will evaluate explanations of drug-drug interactions generated by two systems:
- **System A**: Template-based explanations
- **System B**: LLM-generated explanations

For each case, rate BOTH explanations on the following dimensions (1-5 scale):

### Faithfulness
_How accurately does the explanation represent the drug interaction facts?_

- **1**: Contains major factual errors
- **3**: Mostly accurate with minor issues
- **5**: Completely accurate

### Fluency
_How well-written and grammatical is the explanation?_

- **1**: Many grammar/spelling errors
- **3**: Generally readable
- **5**: Professional quality writing

### Completeness
_Does the explanation cover all important interactions and risks?_

- **1**: Missing major information
- **3**: Covers main points
- **5**: Comprehensive coverage

### Clarity
_How easy is it to understand the explanation?_

- **1**: Confusing or unclear
- **3**: Understandable with effort
- **5**: Crystal clear

### Clinical Utility
_Would this explanation help a clinician make decisions?_

- **1**: Not useful
- **3**: Somewhat helpful
- **5**: Very helpful for decision-making
