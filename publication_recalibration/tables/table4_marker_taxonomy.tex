\caption{\textbf{Semantic Severity Prototypes.}
Representative descriptions for each severity class used in sentence embedding-based classification.
New interaction descriptions are classified based on cosine similarity to these prototype centroids,
enabling robust generalization beyond fixed keyword matching.}
