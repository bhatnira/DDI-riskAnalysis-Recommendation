- in combination with hyaluronidase (human recombinant) as a maintenance therapy in adults with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneurop","IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins.

NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by ",N[C@@H](CCCNC(N)=O)C(O)=O,RHGKLRLOHDJJDR-BYPYZUCNSA-N,175.1857,-3.9,9750,CHEMBL444814,D07706

Furthermore, such management is generally predominantly associated with the symptomatic relief of transient and short-term insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings and/or early morning awakenings [F3718]. In particular, the official prescribing information for temazepam typically specifies that the instructions issued for dispensed prescriptions of the medication should indicate specifically that patients are only expected to use the therapy for short periods of time - usually 7-10 days in general [FDA Label, F3718]. Subsequently, treatment with temazepam should usually not exceed 7 to 10 consecutive days and nor should it be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply [F3718].

When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].

Levonorgestrel, in the single-agent emergency contraceptive form, is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy after the confirmed or suspected failure of contraception methods or following unprotected intercourse.

Oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.[T659]

**Mechanism of action in cervical mucus changes**

Similar to other levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, the intrauterine (IUD) forms of levonorgestrel likely prevent pregnancy by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus, interfering with the movement and survival of sperm, and inducing changes in the endometrium, where a fertilized ovum is usually implanted.[L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel is reporte",[H][C@@]12CC[C@@](O)(C#C)[C@@]1(CC)CC[C@]1([H])[C@@]3([H])CCC(=O)C=C3CC[C@@]21[H],WWYNJERNGUHSAO-XUDSTZEESA-N,312.4458,3.66,13109,CHEMBL1389,D00950

Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both _dihydropyridine_ and _nondihydropyridine_ binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label].

After ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (_alloxanthine_) in the liver [T508], which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA label]. 

Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase).  This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations [F3988], which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms.

A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use.

**A note on duration of treatment**

Recommendations for treatment of menopausal symptoms changed drastically following the release of results and early termination of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies in 2002 as concerns were raised regarding estrogen u","Estrogen is found in the the breast, uterine, ovarian, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain tissues. The main source of estrogen in adult women during the reproductive period of life is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol each day. After menopause, however, the majority of endogenous estrogen is produced by transformation of androstenedione (which is secreted by the adrenal cortex) to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.[L11530] 

Estradiol, however, is considerably more potent than estrone and estriol at the estrogen receptor (ER). As a result, the higher estrone concentration in postmenopausal population, can cause various undesirable effects. These effects may include hot flashes, chills, vaginal dryness, mood swings, irregular menstruation, and chills, in addition to sleep problems.[L11530]

Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 

It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2.

The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by ganciclovir triphosphate.

Virginiamycin M1 has proven to be highly active against Gram positive bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus.",CC(C)[C@H]1OC(=O)C2=CCCN2C(=O)C2=COC(=N2)CC(=O)C[C@H](O)\C=C(/C)\C=C\CNC(=O)\C=C\[C@H]1C,DAIKHDNSXMZDCU-FQTGFAPKSA-N,525.5934,2.38,5459319,CHEMBL1236670,C11299
DB01685,Topiroxostat,small molecule,577778-58-6,0J877412JV,,investigational,Indicated for the treatment of gout and hyperurcemia in Japan.,"Uric acid synthesis depends on the action of xanthine oxidase activity in the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine, followed by the conversion of xanthine to uric acid. Xanthine oxidase consists of a molybdenum ion as cofactor in the active center that has different redox states upon substrate binding [L867]. When a substrate such as hypoxanthine or xanthine binds, xanthine oxidase hydroxylates it and molybdenum ion is reduced from hexavalent, Mo(VI), to tetravalent form, Mo(IV). Molybdenum ion is reoxidized into hexavalent state once the hydroxylated substrate, xanthine or uric acid, dissociates from the active site. Topiroxostat is shown to interact with multiple amino acid residues of the solvent channel and additionally forms a reaction intermediate by covalent binding with molybdenum (IV) ion via an oxygen atom [A19657, L867, A19662, A19663]. It also forms hydrogen bonds with molybdenum (VI) ion, suggesting that it has multiple inhibition modes to xanthine oxidase [L867].

Additionally, DHEA has shown promise in improving symptoms of lupus (SLE). Taking DHEA by mouth along with conventional treatment may help reduce the number of times symptoms flare up and may allow a reduction in the dose of prescription drugs needed. DHEA may also help SLE symptoms such as muscle ache and mouth ulcers. DHEA also seems to strengthen bones in SLE patients being treated with high-dose steroids (corticosteroids).

As most DHEA is produced by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, it is argued that there is a role in the immune and stress response.

By inhibiting histone deacetylase, vorinostat causes the accumulation of acetylated histones and induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of vorinostat has not been fully characterized.",ONC(=O)CCCCCCC(=O)NC1=CC=CC=C1,WAEXFXRVDQXREF-UHFFFAOYSA-N,264.3202,2,5311,CHEMBL98,D06320

Microtubules are essential to cell division, and epothilones therefore stop cells from properly dividing. Epothilone B possess the same biological effects as taxol both in vitro and in cultured cells. This is because they share the same binding site, as well as binding affinity to the microtubule. Like taxol, epothilone B binds to the αβ-tubulin heterodimer subunit. Once bound, the rate of αβ-tubulin dissociation decreases, thus stabilizing the microtubules. Furthermore, epothilone B has also been shown to induce tubulin polymerization into microtubules without the presence of GTP. This is caused by formation of microtubule bundles throughout the cytoplasm. Finally, epothilone B also causes cell cycle arrest at the G2-M transition phase, thus leading to cytotoxicity and eventually cell apoptosis.",[H]\C(=C(\C)[C@]1([H])C[C@]2([H])O[C@]2(C)CCC[C@]([H])(C)[C@]([H])(O)[C@@]([H])(C)C(=O)C(C)(C)[C@@]([H])(O)CC(=O)O1)C1=CSC(C)=N1,QXRSDHAAWVKZLJ-PVYNADRNSA-N,507.683,4.12,448013,CHEMBL94657,C12154

Compared to cocaine, vanoxerine has a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter and a slower dissociation rate, without the stimulant profile of cocaine.[A37914] The use of vanoxerine to treat conditions characterized by low levels of dopamine, such as Parkinson's disease and depression, has also been investigated.[A248550]

It is the first non-opioid medication for the symptomatic management of opioid discontinuation.[L2801]

Opioid withdrawal syndrome is a debilitating manifestation of opioid dependence.[A33085] This condition is extremely unpleasant lasting several days with some of the main features being abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, mydriasis, lacrimation, and piloerection. These symptoms are often observed after abrupt reductions in the opioid dose and can be resolved by re-administration of the opioid.[A33088]","Lofexidine is a potent alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist with some moderate agonistic affinity towards Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor and 5-HT1a, 5-HT7, 5HT2c and 5HT1d receptors.[L2801]

The alpha2-adrenergic receptor is normally targeted by norepinephrine and its activation inhibits the synthesis of cAMP which in turn leads to potassium efflux and suppression of neural firing and inhibition of norepinephrine release. All of this activity can reduce the heart rate, blood pressure, and attenuate sympathetic stress response.[L2801]

Opioids inhibit cAMP in the noradrenergic neurons and their discontinuation produces a rise in the level of cAMP. This will generate an increase in norepinephrine which is associated with the symptoms of withdrawal. The magnitude of the effect is augmented by chronic opioid use due to the compensatory mechanisms of continuous negative feedback. Therefore, chronic opioid use translates into an exacerbated production of cAMP and norepinephrine release.[L280",CC(OC1=C(Cl)C=CC=C1Cl)C1=NCCN1,KSMAGQUYOIHWFS-UHFFFAOYSA-N,259.132,2.66,30668,CHEMBL17860,

The antibody portion is trastuzumab, which is humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, and produced in the mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The drug portion is DM1, which is a maytansine derivative that inhibits microtubules. These two portions are covalently connected by 4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC), which is a stable thioether linker. Together MCC and DM1 are called emtansine and are produced by chemical synthesis.

Trastuzumab emtansine binds to the HER2 receptor’s sub-domain IV and goes into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Lysosomes degrade trastuzumab emtansine and release DM1. DM1 binds to tubulin in microtubules and inhibits microtubule function producing cell arrest and apoptosis.

Central to the coagulation process is the serine protease thrombin (FIIa), which is synthesized as inactive prothrombin (FII) and subsequently activated by FXa/FVa, leading to a positive feedback loop and the production of large quantities of thrombin; once enough thrombin is formed, it cleaves soluble fibrinogen to form insoluble fibrin fibres that, together with aggregated platelets, form a clot. Although beneficial in wound healing, aberrant thrombus formation can lead to serious health consequences.[A236205]

Some of the biochemical mechanisms discovered so far concern agmatine's indication for diabetes, neuroprotection, and psychiatric conditions. In diabetes, agmatine produces hypoglycemia by increasing the release of insulin form pancreatic islet cells and increasing glucose uptake by the cells through increased endorphin release from the adrenal glands. Concerning neuroprotection, agmatine's effects are thought to involve modulation of receptors (NMDA, alpha 2, and imidazoline) and ion channels (ATP sensitive potassium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels) as well as blocking nitric oxide synthesis. Agmatine blocks nitric oxide synthesis by reducing the nitric oxide synthase -2 (NOS-2) protein in astroglial cells and macrophages.

A majority of breast cancers are estrogen sensitive. Estrogen sensitive breast cancer cells depend on estrogen for viability. Thus removal of estrogen from the body can be an effective treatment for hormone sensitive breast cancers.

Formestane has been targeted specifically for the treatment of postmenopausal women. Unlike premenopausal women who produce most estrogen in the ovaries, postmenopausal women produce most estrogen in peripheral tissues with the help of the aromatase enzyme. Formestane, an aromatase inhibitor, can thus help to decrease the local production of estrogen by blocking the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues (ie. adispose tissue of the breast) to treat hormone sensitive breast cancer.",[H][C@@]12CCC(=O)[C@@]1(C)CC[C@@]1([H])[C@@]2([H])CCC2=C(O)C(=O)CC[C@]12C,OSVMTWJCGUFAOD-KZQROQTASA-N,302.4079,3.41,11273,CHEMBL132530,D07260

More recently focus has shifted to the use of beclamide in behavioural disorders. In mentally handicapped epileptic patients it has been found to decrease anxiety, antisocial and demanding behaviours, and impulsivity. Mood stabilizing effects were also noted. [2]

Additionally, due to its effects on monoamines, beclamide may have a potential place in treating conditions such as tardive dyskinesia and hyperkinetic syndromes. [2]","Beclamide has been used for over three decades with little knowledge of how it acts in the CNS. In one study using rats, beclamide was seen to reduce striatal dopamine and serotonin levels and increase the levels of dopamine's major metabolites (and thus dopamine turnover), while reducing the levels of serotonin's major metabolite below detectable levels. A similar effect on neurotransmitter levels was seen in the rat frontal cortices.

Nicorandil is an activator and opener of ATP-sensitive (ATP-dependent) potassium channels (KATP channels) that are composed of Kir6.x-type subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Nicorandil binding sites are located in the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel [A20322], which are regulatory subunits of the channel that exhibit an ATPase activitiy [A12436]. There are 2 types of SUR2 subunits (2A/2B) that have identical nucleotide binding domains (NBD), where SUR2A is more predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes and SUR2B in smooth muscle cells [A12436]. Nicorandil more potently activates SUR2B/Kir6.2 than SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels to cause hyperpolarization. ATP-NBD1 interaction influences the channel signalling by nicorandil, and the response of the channel to nicorandil is also facilitated and heightened by the interaction of ATP or ADP with NBD2 [A20321].

FPA is separated rapidly and the remaining molecule is a soluble fibrin monomer (fibrin I).

Its anticancer properties may be explained by the oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups. Tumor cells express free sulfhydryl groups (–SH) on the surface of their cell membranes and contribute to uncontrolled cell division. Only those compounds that can oxidize these groups to disulfides (S–S) may inhibit this process.

The key features of pulmonary arterial hypertension include a decrease in prostacyclin and prostacyclin synthase (enzyme that helps produce prostacyclin) in the lung. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator with anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic effects; therefore, there is strong rationale for treatment with IP receptor agonists. Selexipag is chemically distinct as it is not PGI2 or a PGI2 analogue and has high selectivity for the IP receptor. It is metabolized by carboxylesterase 1 to yield an active metabolite (ACT-333679) that is approximately 37 times more potent than selexipag. Both selexipag and its metabolite are selective for the IP receptor over other prostanoid receptors.",CC(C)N(CCCCOCC(=O)NS(C)(=O)=O)C1=NC(C2=CC=CC=C2)=C(N=C1)C1=CC=CC=C1,QXWZQTURMXZVHJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,496.63,3.76,9913767,CHEMBL238804,D09994

It is specifically used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing the ALK-EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) fusion protein that causes proliferation of NSCLC cells. Inhibition of ALK prevents phosphorylation and subsequent downstream activation of STAT3 and AKT resulting in reduced tumour cell viability.

Rheinanthrone [DB13175] appears to increase cyclooxegenase 2 (COX2) expression in macrophage cells leading to an increase in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)[A19235]. This increase in PGE2 is associated with a decrease in aquaporin 3 expression in mucosal epithelial cells of the large intestine[A19235]. A decrease in aquaporin 3 expression likely produces the laxative effect by restricting water reabsorption by the large intestine thereby increasing fecal water content[A19235]. The exact mechanism by which rheinanthrone increases COX2 expression is unknown[A19235]. Rheinanthrone [DB13175] also stimulates peristalsis in the large intestine although the mechanism behind this effect is unknown[A19239].

PBPs are responsible for catalyzing the transpeptidase reaction which cross-links the peptide side chains on the sugar residues of a peptidoglycan unit, adding the unit to the peptidoglycan layer. This disrupts the balance between the hydrolysis of peptidoglycan, in order to insert new peptidoglycan units, by murein hydrolase and the attachment of the new units which leads to overall destruction of the peptidoglycan layer. With the loss of its peptidoglycan layer the cell also loses its resistance to the high osmotic pressure inside its membrane and lyses.",[H][C@]12SCC(OC)=C(N1C(=O)[C@H]2NC(=O)[C@H](N)C1=CCC=CC1)C(O)=O,RDMOROXKXONCAL-UEKVPHQBSA-N,365.4,-3.4,5284529,CHEMBL3186538,D01528

Preventing the Bcl-2-like proteins from binding to the executioners might be able to trigger cell death in the tumor.",[H][C@@](CCN1CCOCC1)(CSC1=CC=CC=C1)NC1=C(C=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)NC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)N1CCN(CC2=C(CCC(C)(C)C2)C2=CC=C(Cl)C=C2)CC1)S(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F,JLYAXFNOILIKPP-KXQOOQHDSA-N,974.613,7.93,24978538,CHEMBL443684,

The acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins causes an increase or decrease in gene expression, respectively, with the latter function governed by HDACs.

At certain doses, the combination product of levodopa and benserazide may also be used to treat restless legs syndrome, which is sometimes associated with Parkinson's disease [L2553, T181].

There have also been some studies that have prompted the European Medicines Agency to confer orphan designation upon benserazide  hydrochloride as a potential therapy for beta thalassaemia [F3]. Although studies are ongoing, no evidence has been formally elucidated as of yet [F3].","The combination of levodopa and benserazide is an anti-Parkinsonian agent [F2, L2553]. Levodopa itself is the metabolic precursor of dopamine. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine is depleted to a large degree in the striatum, pallidum, and substantia nigra in the central nervous system (CNS) [F2, L2553]. The administration of levodopa to treat the disease is subsequently proposed to facilitate raises in the levels of available dopamine in these areas [F2, L2553]. The metabolism of levodopa to dopamine occurs via the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, although unfortunately, this metabolism can also occur in extracerebral tissues [F2, L2553]. As a result, the full therapeutic effect of an administered dose of levodopa may not be obtained if portions of it are catabolized outside of the CNS and various patient adherence diminishing extracerebral side effects due to the extracerebral presence of dopamine like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias can also happen [F2, L2553].

This molecule has been approved and widely accepted to be used in veterinary for pain reduction in arthritis.[A39835] In humans, it has been researched to be used in the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis.[A39844, A39843]

The effect of grapiprant can be explained through the function of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which is a key mediator of swelling redness and pain which are classic signs of inflammation. The effect of PGE2 results from its action through four receptor EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 from which the EP4 is the primary mediator of PGE2-driven inflammation.[A39817]","Grapiprant is an EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist and thus the activity of this drug is thought to be completely related to the selective blockade of this receptor.[A39816] It binds to human and other mammals EP4 prostaglandin receptor with high affinity without interfering with other prostaglandin pathways which are important for a variety of physiological functions. The binding of grapiprant blocks PGE2 binding and hence its biological effect related to the signaling pain and inflammation cascade.[A39835]

Grapiprant has been accepted very greatly in veterinary as its mechanism of action is a targeted approach to pain management by not having any interaction with the production of prostanoids and thus, by not interacting with other prostaglandin receptor pathways.[A39816]",CCC1=NC2=C(C)N=C(C)C=C2N1C1=CC=C(CCNC(=O)NS(=O)(=O)C2=CC=C(C)C=C2)C=C1,HZVLFTCYCLXTGV-UHFFFAOYSA-N,491.61,2.27,11677589,CHEMBL3039498,

Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 A-subunits and 2 B-subunits (A2B2)[A32363]. When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. As a result, the active transglutaminase from subunit A cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot. This contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to injured tissue, thereby improving blood coagulation and maintenance of hemostasis [A18581].

It also binds to purine nucleotides in the DNA. The active form allows for two binding interactions to form cross-links between these nucleotides.

Elsewhere bendazac may still be available in a limited capacity as a non-prescription topical cream product for treating conditions like local pain, inflammation, dermatitis, eczema, pruritis, hives, insect bites, burns, erythema, and others [L4780] - although such products may also be facing general discontinuation [L4781].","Bendazac seems to elicit an anticataract action by inhibiting the denaturation of ocular lens proteins, although the precise mechanisms by which this action occurs has not yet been formally elucidated - despite there being many proposed mechanisms [A39863, A39869]. In particular, the denaturation of lens proteins may in part be prevented by inhibiting the binding of certain chemicals like cyanates or sugars and 5-hydroxybendazac - the major metabolite of bendazac - has been shown to be capable of inhibiting the glycosylation of lens proteins by sugars like galactose or glucose-6-phosphate in a dose-dependent manner [A39869]. Moreover, the apparent ability for administered bendazac to elicit free radical scavenger activities due to interactions with protein molecules suggests that the medication may also be able to prevent the oxidation of lens proteins by free radicals in the development of cataracts [A39863, A39869]. Furthermore, bendazac may also be capable of reducing the sulfhydryl",OC(=O)COC1=NN(CC2=CC=CC=C2)C2=CC=CC=C12,BYFMCKSPFYVMOU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,282.299,3.06,,CHEMBL1089221,

These structural features contribute to the formation of a curved dimer in which most amino acid side chains are located on the convex surface. The dimer orients itself at the membrane-water interface on bacterial cells with the relatively hydrophilic back-bone on the concave side facing the external environment and the many hydrophobic side chains on the convex side facing into the cell's lipid bilayer. The tyrocidine dimer is able to disrupt the cell membrane producing leakage of cell contents but the exact mechanism of this permeabilization is unclear.

Tyrocidines appear to act as reversible non-competitive inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and β-galactosidase [A32867]. The relation of this to their antibacterial action is unknown.

Gramcidins adopt similar  β-sheet structures but are capable of forming β-helices [A32873]. They can either form a double helix, running either parallel or anti-para",,,,,,CHEMBL577736,

Mifamurtide is referred to as MTP-PE or L-MTP-PE (in case of the liposomal formulation), which is a fully synthetic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif within the peptidoglycan polymer in the cell wall of bacteria. 

MDP stimulates the immune system by being recognized by different pattern recognition molecules and receptors, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 receptor and toll-like receptor (TLR). Similarly, mifamurtide acts as a ligand for TRL4 and NOD2. Involved in the innate immunity, NOD2 is an intracellular MDP sensor that is primarily expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. It possesses an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain, which is required to trigger nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling [A31745].

Potassium supplements are indicated to prevent hypokalemia in patients who would be at particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop (e.g., digitalis treated patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias). Potassium deficiency occurs when the rate of loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract is higher than the rate of potassium intake. In addition to serving as a preventative supplement, potassium gluconate also serves as a treatment for decreased potassium levels [L2655], [L2651], [L2657].","Potassium is the most abundant cation (approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter) within human cells. Intracellular sodium content is relatively low. In the extracellular fluid, sodium predominates and the potassium content is low (3.5 to 5 mEq per liter). A membrane-bound enzyme, sodium-potassium–activated adenosinetriphosphatase (Na +K +ATPase), actively transports or pumps sodium out and potassium into cells to maintain the concentration gradients. The intracellular to extracellular potassium gradients are necessary for nerve impulse signaling in such specialized tissues as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and for the maintenance of physiologic renal function and maintenance of acid-base balance. High intracellular potassium concentrations are necessary for numerous cellular metabolic processes [L2655].

Intracellular K+ serves as a reservoir to limit the fall in extracellular potassium concentrations occurring under pathologic conditions with loss of potassium from the body [L",[K+].[H][C@@](O)(CO)[C@@]([H])(O)[C@]([H])(O)[C@@]([H])(O)C([O-])=O,HLCFGWHYROZGBI-JJKGCWMISA-M,234.245,-3.4,16760467,CHEMBL2106978,D01298

Other pyrethroids are now used in place of bioallethrin.,"Bioallethrin, like other pyrethroids, binds to voltage gated sodium channels in their closed state and modifies the gating kinetics [A4852]. Channel opening appears to increase affinity of the channel for pyrethroids like bioallethrin. Once bound pyrethroids slow both the opening and closing of the sodium channel resulting in a need for stronger excitatory potentials to produce an action potential and a delay in repolarization. The these changes make the neuron more susceptible to large action potentials and repeated firing by both increasing the initial threshold and reducing the input needed for after-potentials. When repeated firing does occur, the nerve terminal will release more neurotransmitter which can produce muscle paralysis through tetanus. This paralysis stops the breathing of lice and scabies parasites resulting in death.

Magnesium is very important for the normal physiologic functioning of cells, nerves, muscles, bones, and the heart. Generally, a well-balanced diet provides the necessary amounts of magnesium for homeostasis. However, certain conditions causing chronic magnesium deficiency may decrease levels of magnesium.

By competing with calcium for membrane binding sites and by stimulating calcium sequestration by sarcoplasmic reticulum, magnesium helps in the maintenance of a low resting intracellular free calcium ion concentration, which is essential in various cellular functions.

Magnesium is essential to many enzymatic reactions in the body, serving as a cofactor in protein synthesis and in carbohydrate metabolism [L2606].

Magnesium contributes to the structural development of bone and is also essential in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione.

In essence, calcium levulinate is ultimately a relatively new calcium supplementation option [L2767].","Much like most calcium supplements, once calcium levulinate dissociates in the body after administration, absorption of the supplemental calcium ions across the intestinal wall serves to enhance calcium stores in the body [L2765, L2767, A33038].

Regardless, levulinic acid (LA) is a commonly used chemical with one carbonyl group, one carboxyl group, and alpha-H comprised in its inner structure, which belongs to short-chain and non-volatile fatty acids [L2767]. Moreover, the carbon-oxygen double bond from LA's carbonyl group possesses a strong polarity, where the oxygen atom has a stronger electron attracting ability compared to the carbon atom, such that the pi electron will ultimately transfer into the greater electronegative oxygen, therefore resulting in the formation of a positive charge center in the carbon atom [L2767]. The electrophilic center of the carbon atom subsequently plays a critical role when the carbonyl group performs chemical reactions [L2767].

Hemophilia B is the second most common type of hemophilia. It is a rare inherited bleeding disorder caused by reduced or absent levels of factor IX (FIX). The FIX is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protease that when activated is involved in the blood coagulation cascade.[A32551] The hemophilia B is caused by mutations in the _FIX_ gene which can cause different phenotypes. The severe form is characterized by the presence of spontaneous and recurring bleeds into the joints and muscles and excessive bleeding after trauma or surgery.[A32552]","The current therapies against hemophilia B are hampered by the short half-life of the replacement FIX therapy.[A32547] Thus, to solve this problem, in rIX-RFP there is the fusion of rFIX with rAlbumin which presents a much longer half-life and it does not present interactions with the immune system.[A32547]

The administration of rIX-RFP increases the plasma concentration of FIX, thus addressing the coagulation deficiency of the patient. rIX-RFP is able to circulate in the plasma as an intact zymogen thanks to the pH-dependent binding to FcRn which is a normal protection pathway from lysosomal degradation of albumin.

GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that promotes glycemic control via several different mechanisms, including insulin secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and reducing postprandial glucagon secretion. The homeostasis of glucose is dependent on hormones such as insulin and amylin, which are secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas.  Semaglutide is 94% similar to human GLP-1. Analogs of this hormone such as semaglutide stimulate the synthesis of insulin[A31424] by stimulating pancreatic islet cells and reducing glucagon secretion.[A31424]  They directly bind with selectivity to the GLP-1 receptor, causing various beneficial downstream effects that reduce blood glucose in a glucose-dependent fashion.[L8681]

It is unknown how these unique structural features may impact the drug's mechanism of action. The binding of Malacidin B to Lipid II prevents the incorporation of the subunit into the cell wall, disrupting synthesis and likely resulting in death of the bacterial cell. Malacidin B does not appear to form pores nor does it seem to integrate into the cell wall. While this mechanism is similar to that of [DB00512], Malacidin B retains its activity against [DB00512]-resistant pathogens. Unlike other antibiotic agents, Malacidin B also retains its activity in the presence of pulmonary surfactants.",CCC(C)CC\C=C/C=C/C(=O)N[C@@H](C(C)C(O)=O)C(=O)N[C@H]1C(C)NC(=O)[C@@H]2C[C@@H](C)CN2C(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@H](NC(=O)CNC(=O)[C@H](CC(O)=O)NC(=O)[C@@H](NC(=O)[C@H](CCCCN)NC(=O)[C@H](NC1=O)C(C)C)C(O)C(O)=O)C(C)C(O)=O)C(C)C,SMTCDPMWINUUKC-AVBBYWJWSA-N,1263.411,-5.6,,,

Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor [FDA Label]. The desired outcome of antipsuchotic agents in schizophrenia is to inhibit dopaminergic transmission in the limbic system and enhance dopaminergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex. As a partial agonist at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, aripiprazole acts as a functional antagonist in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and reduces the extent of dopaminergic pathway activity.

The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways.

Potassium is indicated to treat a variety of conditions. Firstly, it used to replenish potassium that has been depleted by conditions including but not limited to malabsorption, decreased intake, or excess sodium intake.  The causes of potassium deficiency are numerous. The following indications for potassium are not comprehensive, but include the main indications for which this nutrient is used. Various products and preparations contain potassium.

**Potassium chloride**

Potassium chloride is one of the main preparations of potassium used in a clinical setting. The oral solution is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hypokalemia presenting with or without metabolic alkalosis, in patients who have failed conservative management with potassium-rich foods or diuretic dose titrations.[L8744] The injection form of potassium chloride is indicated to replenish potassium in patients who are not feasible candidates for oral potassium. Highly conc","Potassium ion is the primary intracellular cation found in virtually all body tissues.[L8771] The total amount of body potassium in adults is estimated at 45 millimole (mmol)/kg body weight (about 140 g for an adult weighing 175 pounds; 1 mmol = 1 milliequivalent or 39.1 mg of potassium). Potassium mainly stays in cells, and a small amount can be found in the extracellular fluid. The amount of potassium that stays in the cell (intracellular) is 30 times that of extracellular concentration, creating a transmembrane gradient, regulated by the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) ATPase transporter. This is an important gradient for nerve conduction, muscle contractions, and renal function.[L2652] Vomiting, diarrhea, renal disease, medications, and other conditions that alter potassium excretion or shift it inside or outside of cells. In healthy patients individuals with normal renal function, markedly high or low potassium levels are rare.[L2652]

It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR3), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little.  It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase.

These targets are inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphatase, and glycogen synthase kinase 3(GSK-3)[A176642,L5843].

The “Inositol depletion theory” suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus[A176642]. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate[L5843]. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment[A176642,L5843].

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes.

The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

ADA-SCID is a genetically inherited disorder that is very rare and characterized by a deficiency in the adenosine deaminase enzyme. The patients suffering from this disease often present with a compromised immune system. This condition is characterized by very low levels of white blood cells and immunoglobulin levels which results in severe and recurring infections.[L4656]","The ADA-SCID is caused by the presence of mutations in the ADA gene which is responsible for the synthesis of adenosine deaminase. This enzyme is found throughout the body but it is mainly active in lymphocytes. The normal function of adenosine deaminase is to eliminate deoxyadenosine, created when DNA is degraded, by converting it into deoxyinosine. This degradation process is very important as deoxyadenosine is cytotoxic, especially for lymphocytes. Immature lymphocytes are particularly vulnerable as deoxyadenosine kills them before maturation making them unable to produce their immune function.[L4656]

Therefore, based on the causes of ADA-SCID, elapegademase works by supplementing the levels of adenosine deaminase. Being a recombinant and an _E. coli_-produced molecule, the use of this drug eliminates the need to source the enzyme from animals, as it was previously.[L4654]",,,,,,,
